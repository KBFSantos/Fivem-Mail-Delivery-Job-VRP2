# Fivem Mail Delivery Job (VRP2)

Currently using the [VRP2 framework](https://github.com/vRP-framework/vRP).

There's not much difficulty to convert to old vrp or "vrpex", You can read the [VRP2 Documentation](https://vrp-framework.github.io/vRP/dev/index.html) and convert on your own (I don't support converting this script).

## Features
* ✅ Two Central Post Offices: This script has two post offices, one in los santos (GoPostal) and one in paleto bay (PostOP), each with different uniforms and vehicles for each office.
* ✅ Two Delivery Methods: There are two types of delivery, letters and other packages, each with different objects, animations and delivery styles.
* ✅ Storage System: The delivery vans only carry a limited amount of mail, So it's necessary to go back to the central office to refill the van.
* ✅ Uniform System: To start the job the player needs to wear the uniform with an already defined set that currently uses the standard clothes, and automatically recognizes the character's gender.
* ✅ Garage system: The script has its own garage system without needing any additional dependencies for vehicles.
* ✅ Secure Communication: The script uses vrp tunnel communication with the server in essential functions to prevent hacker exploitation using triggers, This can prevent money hacks for example.

## Dependencies

It's necessary to use the [Qtarget](https://github.com/overextended/qtarget) to interact with the objects
