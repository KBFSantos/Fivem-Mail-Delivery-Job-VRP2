Using [VRP2 framework](https://github.com/vRP-framework/vRP)

[VRP2 Documentation](https://vrp-framework.github.io/vRP/dev/index.html)

## Features
* ✅ Two Post Offices: one in Los Santos (GoPostal) and another in Paleto Bay (PostOP), each with its own uniforms and vehicles.
* ✅ Two Delivery Methods: Letters and Packages, each with different objects, animations, and delivery styles.
* ✅ Storage System: Delivery vans can only carry a limited amount of mail, so it's necessary to return to the central office to refill the van.
* ✅ Uniform System: To begin the job, the player needs to wear a predefined uniform set, currently using standard clothing that automatically adapts to the character's sex.
* ✅ Garage system: This script has its own garage system without needing any additional dependencies for vehicles.
* ✅ Safe Communication: Using VRP Tunnel for server communications in essential functions helps prevent hacker exploitation through triggers, which can, for example, mitigate money hacks.

## Dependencies

It's necessary to use the [Qtarget](https://github.com/overextended/qtarget) to interact with the objects
